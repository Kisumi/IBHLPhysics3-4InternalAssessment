# IB HL Physics 3-4: Internal Assessment

	>>> This is where I have compiled the source code for calculating stars' quantitative values of temperature and luminosity.
	>>> To compile a java source code, type into the command line:
	    $ javac [name of source code].java
	>>> To execute a compiled java program, type into the command line:
	    $ java [name of class file that contains the main method after compilation] [name of any arguments you pass the program]
	>>> For example, if you want to run the Temperature.java file, type:
	    $ java Temperature.java Temperatures.txt
	>>> When executing the programs, never forget to include "Temperatures.txt" or "Luminosities.txt" (depending on which one you are executing) after the file names, or else the programs will not know what to analyze and throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Not pleasant.
	>>> The output of the programs are called FinalTemperatures.txt and FinalLuminosities.txt. They contain a list of quantitative values.
	>>> Thanks for reading the README.
